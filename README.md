# curses-menu
A simple Python menu-based GUI system on the terminal using curses

### Installation
Currently only supports python3.5
The curses library comes bundled with python on Linux and MacOS. Windows users can visit http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#curses and get the build for your platform and Python version.

Then just run python setup.py install from the project directory. PyPi coming soon.

"Topmenu and the submenus are based of the example found at this location http://blog.skeltonnetworks.com/2010/03/python-curses-custom-menuData/
The rest of the work was done by Matthew Bennett and he requests you keep these two mentions when you reuse the code :-)
Basic code refactoring by Andrew Scheller"
